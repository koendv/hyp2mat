 hyp2mat

hyp2mat is a utility which converts HyperLynx files to matlab for electromagnetic simulation, or to PDF for printing.
hyp2mat is distributed with openEMS (http://www.openems.de), a free open-source electromagnetic field solver.

 Installation

hyp2mat can be installed from pre-compiled binaries, or compiled from source:

* Windows binaries ( http://www.kdvelectronics.eu/hyp2mat/hyp2mat-win32-current.zip )
* Linux packages ( https://build.opensuse.org/package/show?package=hyp2mat&project=home%3Asibbi77 )
* To install from source see the file INSTALL for compilation instructions
